# HYDROID
HYDROID (HYDroxyl-Radical fOotprinting Interpretation for DNA) is a python package for the analysis of the experimental data generated by hydroxyl-radical [footprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_footprinting) (HRF) of DNA-protein complexes and its interpretation through comparison to theoretical predictions from molecular models.

## HYDROID features
- 2 in 1: HRF experimental data quantification + theoretical analysis of atomistic structures
- Extracts cleavage intensities at individual DNA nucleotides by a number of constraint fitting algorithms
- Uses both Gaussian and Lorentzian models for band intensities
- Cross-platform python-scripted solution, can be install on Linux, MacOS, Windows
- Completely free and relies on open source components such as ImageJ and FreeSASA
- Provides examples of raw data analysis together with data analysis workflows.

## Quick-start guide

NOTE: HYDROID is a full featured Python-script driven software solution that requires basic familiarity with Python-scripting. 

[HYROID_GUI](https://github.com/intbio/HYDROID_GUI) is a sister package that wraps some basic gel lane quantification functionality into a more user friendly graphical interface. [HYDROID_GUI](https://github.com/intbio/HYDROID_GUI) video tutorial is [available here](https://youtu.be/yQGMtqKzzbA).


### Quick installation
Install Miniconda with Python2.7 for your platform from [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

```
conda install -c hydroid hydroid
```

Test HYDROID:

```
HYDROID_test_exp #Tests exeprimental data analysis module
HYDROID_test_pred #Tests molecular structure analysis module (currently supported on Linux and OSX)
```


For alternative installation instructions for Linux, MacOS and PC see [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

### Start by downloading and modifying an example

```
HYDROID_get_ex1
cd example1
python exp_s2_assign_peaks.py
...
```
